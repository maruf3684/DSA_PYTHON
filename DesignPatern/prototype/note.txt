🔹 Definition

Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that creates new objects by copying an existing object
for avoiding heavy calculation or api call if object is complex (the prototype) instead of creating from scratch.

Short version for interview:

“Prototype pattern clones existing objects to create new ones, avoiding costly creation from scratch.”

🔹 Why use it? (Benefits)
	1.	Fast object creation → Especially if creating the object from scratch is expensive.
	2.	Avoid repetitive code → Just clone and modify if needed.
	3.	Preserve state → The new object starts with the same state as the prototype.
	4.	Flexibility → Can dynamically decide which object to clone at runtime.
