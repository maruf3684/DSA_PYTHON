ðŸ”¹ ACID vs NoSQL (Quick Cheat Sheet)

1. Atomicity
	â€¢	RDBMS: Full guarantee â€” all-or-nothing, multi-row safe.
	â€¢	NoSQL: Usually single-document atomic; multi-document requires special config (MongoDB transactions, Cassandra LWT).

2. Consistency
	â€¢	RDBMS: Enforced by DB constraints, triggers, schema.
	â€¢	NoSQL: Optional; may rely on app logic or configurable rules.

3. Isolation
	â€¢	RDBMS: Supports levels (Read Uncommitted â†’ Serializable) to prevent concurrency issues.
	â€¢	NoSQL: Weak / eventual; concurrent reads may see intermediate states.

4. Durability
	â€¢	RDBMS: Guaranteed once committed; survives crashes.
	â€¢	NoSQL: Depends on config (memory-first vs disk, replication); recent writes can be lost.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:

RDBMS = strong ACID guarantees.
NoSQL = trades strict ACID for speed, scalability, and distributed performance.
