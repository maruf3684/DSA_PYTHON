🔹 Points (short)
	1.	All-or-nothing → transaction fully done or not at all.
	2.	No partial changes.
	3.	Rollback if error.
	4.	Ensures data safety on failure.

🔹 Example (short)

💰 Bank Transfer: Debit A (–100), Credit B (+100).
	•	If credit fails → debit is undone → no money lost.


...............................NO SQL...........................
1️⃣ Atomicity
	•	RDBMS: Full guarantee — all-or-nothing. If any part of transaction fails, DB rolls back.

	•	NoSQL:
	•	Many NoSQL DBs do not support multi-document transactions by default.
	•	Example: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions only in replica sets (v4+), but earlier versions or simpler NoSQL DBs (Cassandra, DynamoDB without LWT) may partially apply changes.
	•	Single-document operations are usually atomic.
