2Ô∏è‚É£ What to Learn / Strengthen Before MSc

Since your goal is Cybersecurity, focus on hands-on security skills and research basics:

a) Web & Application Security
	‚Ä¢	OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, RCE
	‚Ä¢	Secure coding practices (input validation, session management, API security)
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

b) Network & System Security
	‚Ä¢	TCP/IP, firewalls, IDS/IPS basics
	‚Ä¢	Packet analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump
	‚Ä¢	Linux server hardening, privilege escalation prevention

c) Cryptography & Authentication
	‚Ä¢	Symmetric & asymmetric encryption
	‚Ä¢	Hashing, digital signatures, JWT tokens
	‚Ä¢	TLS/SSL basics, OAuth2

d) Cloud Security / DevSecOps
	‚Ä¢	AWS/Azure/GCP security practices
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD pipeline security: scanning for vulnerabilities, secrets management
	‚Ä¢	Docker & Kubernetes security best practices

e) Penetration Testing & Tools
	‚Ä¢	Metasploit, Nmap, Kali Linux tools
	‚Ä¢	Vulnerability scanning, ethical hacking labs
	‚Ä¢	Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges for practical experience

f) Research & Thesis Preparation
	‚Ä¢	GitHub projects demonstrating security skills
	‚Ä¢	Basic knowledge of academic research: reading papers, documenting experiments
	‚Ä¢	Optional: take a short online course on cybersecurity research (Coursera, edX, or MIT OCW)

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optional but Helpful Certifications
	‚Ä¢	CompTIA Security+ (entry-level security)
	‚Ä¢	Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
	‚Ä¢	Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) ‚Äî advanced, practical pentesting
	‚Ä¢	AWS Security Specialty (if cloud security interest)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Suggested Path Forward
	1.	Pick 2‚Äì3 areas to focus on first: Web App Security + Network Security + DevSecOps security
	2.	Create 1‚Äì2 small projects for your portfolio:
	‚Ä¢	e.g., Secure a fintech web app and document vulnerabilities/fixes
	‚Ä¢	e.g., Build a simple pentesting lab in virtual machines
	3.	Document your skills on GitHub ‚Äî this shows professors you can contribute immediately
	4.	Reach out to potential supervisors with your portfolio + strong SOP

‚∏ª

üí° Reality:
With your current skill set, if you learn basic cybersecurity tools and concepts, you‚Äôll be ahead of most applicants. You don‚Äôt need deep research experience yet ‚Äî hands-on skills + motivation + portfolio are enough to get an RA in cybersecurity.
