✅ If interviewer asks: “What is the Factory Pattern?”

You can say:
👉 Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but lets the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
In short: It hides the object creation logic and makes code more flexible.

✅ If interviewer asks: “What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?”

You can say:
👉 Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface to create a group (or family) of related objects, without specifying their concrete classes.
In short: It’s like a factory of factories.
