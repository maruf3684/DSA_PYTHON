🔹 Definition

Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another.

Short version for interview:

“Adapter lets classes with incompatible interfaces collaborate by converting one interface to another.”

🔹 Why use it? (Benefits)
	1.	Reusability → Use existing classes even if their interface doesn’t match what you need.
	2.	Compatibility → Lets you integrate legacy code or third-party libraries.
	3.	Decouples code → Client doesn’t need to know about the adaptation.

🔹 Real-world Example

Imagine you have a US plug but your socket is EU type. You need an adapter to connect them.
