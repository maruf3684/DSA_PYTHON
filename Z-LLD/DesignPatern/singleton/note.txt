🔹 Definition

Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Short version for interview:

“Singleton ensures a class has only one instance and gives a global access point to it.”

🔹 Why use it? (Benefits)
	1.	Single point of control → Only one instance manages shared resources (e.g., config, logging, DB connection).
	2.	Memory efficiency → No unnecessary multiple objects.
	3.	Global access → Any part of the code can access the same instance.
