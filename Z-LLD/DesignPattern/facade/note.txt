🔹 Definition

Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem,
 making it easier for clients to use without dealing with all the internal details.

Short one-liner for interviews:

“Facade pattern gives a simple interface to a complex system, hiding the internal complexity from the client.”

🔹 Why use it? (Benefits)
	1.	Simplifies client interaction → Client doesn’t need to know subsystem details.
	2.	Reduces coupling → Client depends only on the Facade, not multiple classes.
	3.	Improves readability and maintainability → One point of access to the subsystem.
	4.	Flexible → Internals can change without affecting the client.
