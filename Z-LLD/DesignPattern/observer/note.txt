🔹 Definition

Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency
 between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are automatically notified and updated.

Short one-liner for interviews:

“Observer pattern lets an object notify multiple dependents automatically when its state changes.”

🔹 Why use it? (Benefits)
	1.	Decouples objects → Subject doesn’t need to know details of observers.
	2.	Automatic updates → Observers are notified when the subject changes.
	3.	Supports dynamic relationships → Observers can register or unregister at runtime.
	4.	Flexible and reusable → Same subject can have multiple types of observers.
