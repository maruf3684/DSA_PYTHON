📌 Suggested Roadmap for You (Developer → Hacker)
	1.	CompTIA Security+ → learn security fundamentals.
	2.	CEH → structured introduction to hacking & tools.
	3.	OSCP → hands-on penetration testing, industry-respected.
	4.	Optional: specialize with OSWE/OSED, or explore bug bounty hunting.



Once you’re in the field, you can branch into specialties:
	•	OSWE (Web Exploitation) – if you want to specialize in web app hacking.
	•	OSED (Exploit Development) – for advanced binary exploitation.
	•	CompTIA PenTest+ – another hands-on alternative to CEH.
	•	Bug bounty platforms (HackerOne, Bugcrowd) – real-world hacking practice and $$$.



⚡ Also, don’t just do certs → combine them with labs & practice:
	•	TryHackMe (Beginner) → guided hacking labs.
	•	Hack The Box (Intermediate/Advanced) → real-world hacking challenges.
	•	PortSwigger Academy → free, amazing web security training.

Great 🔥 — let’s build you a step-by-step roadmap that mixes certifications + hands-on labs + free resources. This way you don’t just collect certs, you actually become a hacker.

⸻

🛡️ Phase 1 — Foundations (1–2 months)

Before hacking, master the basics.

Learn:
	•	Networking → TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, VPNs, firewalls.
	•	Linux basics → commands, permissions, processes.
	•	Scripting → Python & Bash for automation.

Resources:
	•	Free:
	•	Professor Messer – CompTIA Security+ (YouTube)
	•	OverTheWire Wargames (Linux practice)
	•	Paid (Optional):
	•	CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) – sets a strong base.

✅ Outcome: You understand networks, OS, and basic security terms.

⸻

🔓 Phase 2 — Intro to Hacking (2–3 months)

Now start hacking in a structured way.

Learn:
	•	Reconnaissance & scanning (Nmap, Nikto)
	•	Exploitation basics (Metasploit, SQLi, XSS)
	•	Password attacks (John the Ripper, Hydra)
	•	Wi-Fi hacking (Aircrack-ng)

Resources:
	•	TryHackMe → “Complete Beginner” & “Jr Penetration Tester” paths.
	•	PortSwigger Web Security Academy (Free, amazing for web hacking).
	•	Paid (Optional):
	•	CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) – HR-friendly cert.
	•	Udemy: Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch

✅ Outcome: You can hack into test environments with common tools.

⸻

⚡ Phase 3 — Real Pentesting Skills (4–6 months)

Get closer to real-world penetration testing.

Learn:
	•	Privilege escalation (Windows/Linux)
	•	Persistence & post-exploitation
	•	Custom exploits with Python
	•	Active Directory attacks

Resources:
	•	Hack The Box → start with “Starting Point” then move to “Tier 0–1 machines.”
	•	TryHackMe → “Offensive Pentesting” path.
	•	Paid:
	•	OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) – industry gold standard.
	•	Lab prep: TJ Null’s OSCP Prep list (community-curated machine list).

✅ Outcome: You can perform a penetration test end-to-end and write reports.

⸻

🚀 Phase 4 — Specialize & Advance (after OSCP)

Choose your path depending on interests:
	•	Web App Security → OSWE (Offensive Security Web Expert)
	•	Exploit Development → OSED (Offensive Security Exploit Developer)
	•	Cloud Security → AWS Security Specializations, CCSK
	•	Bug Bounty → HackerOne / Bugcrowd practice

⸻

📅 Suggested Timeline (Flexible)
	•	Months 1–2 → Security+ study, Linux, networking, scripting
	•	Months 3–5 → CEH + TryHackMe labs
	•	Months 6–12 → OSCP prep + Hack The Box
	•	Year 2+ → Specialize (OSWE/OSED/bug bounty)

⸻

⚡ Extra Tips
	•	Join communities: r/ethicalhacking, Discord hacking groups, Twitter/X security folks.
	•	Document your learning → blog, GitHub, LinkedIn. Employers love proof of skills.
	•	Do Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges — many interviewers ask about them.

⸻

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	1.	OSCP first → immediate hands-on, job-ready technical skill
	2.	RHCE or Oracle Java → strengthen systems & dev skills simultaneously
	3.	CISSP last → once you have 3–5 years of experience, for leadership roles
