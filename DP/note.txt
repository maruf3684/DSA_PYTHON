Main types of DP
	1.	1D DP → problems depending on a single dimension (e.g., Fibonacci, climbing stairs).
	2.	2D DP → depends on two parameters (e.g., strings: palindrome, edit distance).
	3.	Knapsack-style DP → capacity + items decisions.
	4.	Graph DP → shortest paths, longest paths in DAG, etc.
	5.	Bitmask DP → DP over subsets.
	6.	Digit DP → counting numbers with certain properties.

Rule of thumb for spotting DP

If your problem:
	•	Has choices at each step,
	•	Has overlapping subproblems,
	•	Needs the best/fastest/cheapest solution,
	•	And you can describe it as “state + decision” →
…it’s a strong DP candidate.
